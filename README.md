# LeapUI
An experiment with diegetic user interfaces in Unreal Engine 4 using Leap Motion

Requires a VR headset with a Leap Motion sensor.

## Includes
Advanced Grass blueprint for ambience<br>
Wrist menu (left hand)<br>
Static 3D menu in world<br>

Controls on the menus do nothing currently, simply proof of concept with 3D widget interaction, something not natively supported by Leap Motion
