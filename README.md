# LeapUI
An experiment with diegetic user interfaces in Unreal Engine 4 using Leap Motion

Requires a VR headset with a Leap Motion sensor.

## Includes
Advanced Grass blueprint for ambience
Wrist menu (left hand)
Static 3D menu in world

Controls on the menus do nothing currently, simply proof of concept with 3D widget interaction, something not natively supported by Leap Motion
